            <p> On January 6, 2021, U.S. President Donald Trump held a rally on the National Mall.  At that rally, 
                he advocated for the crowd to "fight like hell" and "take back their country" after incorrectly 
                and repeatedly claiming that he had won the 2020 Presidential Election.
            </p>
            <p> Even before the speech, many in the crowd had shown up with the intent and tools to attack
                the United States Capitol and ultimately kidnap or kill members of Congress.  Bombs were found by police around the capital. In the days that followed the attack, some of 
                these rioters took to social media to brag about the modicum of "success" they had achieved: 4 deaths, 1 murder, 
                and numerous violent assaults on capitol police.  They freely told us who they were.  It is up to us to decide what to do with that information.
            </p>
            <p> In 1936, Victor Green published his "Green Book" - a listing of safe towns and businesses to help traveling African Americans avoid racism and danger 
                in the Jim Crow south. We aim to do something similar for the modern age.
            </p>
            <p> It is <b>our right</b> to decide whom we buy from, whose rallies we attend, and whom we associate with. And it is our right to choose
                not to support businesses or politicians who fund and foment the destruction of our planet and our democracy.  The problem is that 
                there are so many people and organizations and companies using their money and power to damage the world that it is almost impossible to keep track
                of them all.  Worse still, their wealth allows them to hide their misdeeds.  
            </p>
            <p> This site helps the average person take tiny online actions in the fight for a better world - avoid or boycott websites of organizations that have been credibly accused or found guilty
                of heinous crimes, racism, embezzlement, or even legal but patently unethical action. <i>All blocked companies are listed with sources publicly 
                available for scrutiny.  All blocks are also optional.</i> But we think that it's worth reminding people about the companies who launder 
                $100M and only pay $1M in fines. Companies that cozy up to dicators, lie to shareholders, or swindle homeowners.  Companies whose founders
                advocate for martial law or provide bail money for white supremacist murderers.  Even small businesses whose owners show up to 
                a "peaceful" rally with body-armor and zipties to kindap Congressmen.  All these tiny ills add up.  And so will our tiny boycotts.  
            </p>
