### This is BadBlocker's manifesto
__inspired by uBlock Origin__

1. The **user decides** what web content is acceptable or not in their browser.  
1. Given 1, then **user decides** what websites to do business with.

Users are best placed to know what is or is not acceptable to them. BadBlocker is an opinionated
piece of software, but all blockes are optional as is use of the tool in general.  The list of
blocked websites is public and maintained by users for users.
