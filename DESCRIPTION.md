Blocks websites from a well-sourced list of unethical or criminal persons and corporations.  Recommends ethical alternatives.


BadBlocker is a digital boycott-enablement tool. By using technology similar to an ad blocker, BadBlocker can stop you from visiting a website 
owned and operated by criminals or organizations acting in an unethical manner.  All blocks are optional and can be ignored. Where possible, BadBlocker suggests alternative websites that support social good in their communities.  


✓ PERMISSIONS

Like common ad-blocking extensions Bad Blocker needs to inspect the urls of websites as you visit them.  No in-page data or analytics are collected.
